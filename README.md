This app helps the user acknowledge their speed whilst driving. If they are driving safely, if they should slow down, if they need to pay a fine, or if they need to pay a large fine. 
If the speed in kilometres per hour is less than 60 then you are driving safely.
if the speed in kilometres per hour is from 60 to 80 then you are in a warning zone, you should consider driving carefully.
If the speed in kilometres per hour is from 81 to 100 then you will be faced with a fine of R500.
If the speed in kilometres per hour is 101+ then you will be faced with a larger fine of R200.












 The app has one button named check speed and once pressed checks the speed at which someone is driving and if they are violating any rules of the road. 
Firstly, the user must input their speed into the EditText available in the top.
The app evaluates their speed using an if-else statement.
A TextView will display the above corresponding messages.

what I’ve experienced during the making of the app:
I didn’t face any major issues with the general code, but there was an error regarding me putting an addition/+ sign in front of the id view for the textview , button , and edittext.

 
Thereafter my code had no errors.
